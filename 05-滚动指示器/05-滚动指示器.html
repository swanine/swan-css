      <h2>What is Elasticsearch?</h2>
      <p>
        ou know, for search (and analysis) Elasticsearch is the distributed
        search and analytics engine at the heart of the Elastic Stack. Logstash
        and Beats facilitate collecting, aggregating, and enriching your data
        and storing it in Elasticsearch. Kibana enables you to interactively
        explore, visualize, and share insights into your data and manage and
        monitor the stack.
      </p>
      <p>
        Elasticsearch is where the indexing, search, and analysis magic happens.
        Elasticsearch provides near real-time search and analytics for all types
        of data. Whether you have structured or unstructured text, numerical
        data, or geospatial data, Elasticsearch can efficiently store and index
        it in a way that supports fast searches.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can go far beyond simple data retrieval and aggregate information to
        discover trends and patterns in your data. And as your data and query
        volume grows, the distributed nature of Elasticsearch enables your
        deployment to grow seamlessly right along with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        While not every problem is a search problem, Elasticsearch offers speed
        and flexibility to handle data in a wide variety of use cases: Add a
        search box to an app or website Store and analyze logs, metrics, and
        security event data Use machine learning to automatically model the
        behavior of your data in real time Automate business workflows using
        Elasticsearch as a storage engine Manage, integrate, and analyze spatial
        information using Elasticsearch as a geographic information system (GIS)
        Store and process genetic data using Elasticsearch as a bioinformatics
        research tool We’re continually amazed by the novel ways people use
        search.
      </p>

      But whether your use case is similar to one of these, or you’re using
      Elasticsearch to tackle a new problem, the way you work with your data,
      documents, and indices in Elasticsearch is the same.
